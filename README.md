 This is a prototype doodling app built for Android systems. Currently, it allows its user to:

Draw lines on a white canvas using a brush
Change the color and size of the brush
Change the opacity of the color selected
Draws straight lines using a line tool
Clear the entire canvas

This was built for Jon Froelich's CMSC434 class and used his video demo on creating a custom class as a base, in addition it used Sue Smith's tutrial as a refrence.
